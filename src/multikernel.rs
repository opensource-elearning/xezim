//! True per-LP PDES (Parallel Discrete Event Simulation) skeleton.
//!
//! This module provides a from-scratch coordinator that runs N independent
//! event loops on N host threads, synchronized through bounded message
//! channels at clock edges (conservative CMB protocol). It does NOT reuse
//! `compiler::Simulator::event_loop`; the existing event loop owns global
//! state (event_queue, nba_fast, clock_generators, dirty tracking) that
//! is fundamentally incompatible with per-LP independent time advancement.
//!
//! ## Status
//!
//! Worktree experiment (branch `perlp-experiment`). Goal of this branch:
//! prove the architecture on a toy 2-module Verilog design (two clocked
//! counters + 1 shared signal). Once the toy passes, the next session can
//! evaluate whether the same coordinator scales to c910-sized designs.
//!
//! ## What's here
//!
//! - `PdesKernel`: owns one LP's slice of state — its signal subset,
//!   compiled edge blocks, event queue, NBA buffer, local sim_time.
//! - `BoundaryChannel`: ordered (sim_time, signal_id, value) message
//!   queue from a producing kernel to a consuming kernel. Implements
//!   the CMB lookahead lower-bound for the consumer's local time.
//! - `ClockBarrier`: classic N-thread barrier with generation counter,
//!   used to sync all kernels at common clock-edge "rendezvous" points.
//! - `PdesCoordinator`: top-level orchestrator. Spawns kernel threads,
//!   wires the channel topology, drives global sim_time forward through
//!   barrier ticks.
//!
//! ## What's NOT here (stubs / handed off)
//!
//! - Full SV preprocessor / parser integration — kernels are constructed
//!   directly from precompiled `KernelSpec` today.
//! - Settle fixed-point iteration — only level-sensitive comb blocks
//!   need this; the toy test uses edge-only `always @(posedge clk)`.
//! - NBA queue (only `nba_fast` analog present); array-element NBAs.
//! - `$display` / `$finish` / `$readmemh` plumbing back to a designated
//!   I/O kernel — toy test exits when local_time exceeds a fixed
//!   `max_sim_time`.
//! - Width-resize / signedness coercion on NBA apply — toy assumes
//!   homogenous widths.
//!
//! See `xezim/docs/MULTIKERNEL.md` for the full scaling roadmap to
//! c910-class designs.
