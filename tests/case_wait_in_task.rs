//! IEEE 1800-2023 §9.7.4 — a `wait` inside a `case` reached on the
//! suspend-aware (process) path must BLOCK until its condition is true, not
//! fall through.
//!
//! Root cause this guards: `run_process_stmts` (the suspend-aware statement
//! runner) had native arms for blocking constructs (Wait, If, While, …) but
//! none for `case`. When an inlined task body was a `case` whose matched arm
//! held a `wait` (UVM's `uvm_phase::wait_for_state`:
//! `case(op) UVM_EQ: wait((state & m_state) != 0);`), it fell through to the
//! synchronous `exec_statement(Case)`, where a false `wait` with no parking
//! continuation either silently returned or stranded the process — the waiter
//! never blocked on the (later-satisfied) condition. This made UVM cleanup
//! phases fire before the runtime sub-phases completed.
//!
//! The fix added a suspend-aware Case handler mirroring the If handler. These
//! tests pin the semantics: the chosen arm's `wait` must block, and a
//! non-blocking arm must still run and let execution continue.
