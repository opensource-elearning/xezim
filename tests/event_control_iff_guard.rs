//! IEEE 1800-2023 §9.4.2.3 event-control `iff` guard.
//!
//! `@(posedge clk iff rst_l === 1'b1)` must block until a posedge of `clk`
//! that occurs while the guard holds — the classic "wait for the first
//! clock after reset deasserts" idiom. xezim used to parse the `iff` but
//! drop it in `event_to_sens`, so the wait resolved on the very first
//! posedge (still in reset), letting the stimulus start too early.
