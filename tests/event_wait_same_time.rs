//! An `@(signal)` waiter must wake from a change to that signal made LATER in

//! response" pattern. xezim used to blanket-suppress every waiter registered in
//! the current snapshot generation, so an NBA or cross-process write at the
//! same time never woke it (the waiter blocked forever). Fixed by checking such
//! a waiter against its ARM-TIME sensitivity values, so a genuine post-arm
//! change fires it while a pre-arm edge (a `forever @(posedge clk)` re-arm, or
//! time-0 init pseudo-edges) still correctly does not.
