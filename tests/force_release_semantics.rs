//! IEEE 1800-2017 §10.6 force/release and §10.6.1 procedural continuous
//! assignments (assign/deassign) — native SystemVerilog statements.
//!
//! While a target is forced (§10.6.2) or procedurally assigned (§10.6.1),
//! ordinary procedural assignments and continuous-driver changes must be
//! ignored. On `release`, a VARIABLE retains the forced value until the
//! next procedural assignment; a NET returns to the value produced by its
//! continuous drivers. `deassign` likewise retains the last assigned value.
