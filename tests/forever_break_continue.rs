//! IEEE 1800-2023 §9.3.3 — a `break`/`continue` inside a `forever` body that
//! can block (suspend) must be honoured when the process resumes, not silently
//! dropped while the loop re-arms for the next iteration.
//!
//! Root cause this guards: `run_process_stmts` (the suspend-aware statement
//! runner) ran a blocking `forever` via `exec_forever_sched`, which on
//! suspension re-appended a `Forever { body }` statement as the resume
//! continuation. On resume, the `Forever` arm called `exec_forever_sched`
//! again WITHOUT checking the `break_flag`/`continue_flag`/`return_flag` the
//! body had set — so a `break` was lost and the loop ran an extra iteration.
//! (Gating the `Forever` arm directly was rejected earlier: it fired on stale
//! flags before the body ran even once and deadlocked loops whose body only
//! decides to break after its first suspension. The fix is the `ForeverTail`
//! sentinel — first entry goes through `Forever` ungated; re-entry goes
//! through `ForeverTail`, which runs the loop-control gate. This mirrors the
//! `ForeachTail` design.)
//!
//! These tests pin the semantics: break exits, continue skips to the next
//! iteration, and a wait-driven forever breaks correctly under delta-sensitive
//! resumption (condition-waiter wakeup, not an edge).
