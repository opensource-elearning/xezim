//! Two silent-corruption bugs found by the clause-6 / clause-9 LRM audits.
//!
//! 1. Writing a struct member could clobber an UNRELATED module signal.
//!    `p.a = 5` is a member access, but name resolution treated the dotted name
//!    as a hierarchical instance path; when `p.a` was not in the compact signal
//!    table the suffix scan collapsed it to its LAST segment and wrote a
//!    module-scope signal that happened to be called `a`. Silent: `p.a` still
//!    read back 5, while `a` (or `a[0..]`) was destroyed.
//!
//! 2. `#5 -> ev;` dropped its delay. `->` is registered as the constraint
//!    implication infix operator, so the bare delay value was parsed with a
//!    full `parse_expression` and became `#(5 -> ev)`: the trigger was
//!    swallowed and the delay evaluated to 0. `#5; -> ev;`, `#5 ->> ev;` and
//!    `#5 begin -> ev; end` all worked, which is what hid it.
