//! Regression: a REAL literal in a combinational context (continuous assign
//! or `always @(*)`) was truncated to an integer.
//!
//! The bytecode compiler's `eval_number_static` lowered `NumberLiteral::Real(f)`
//! as `Value::from_u64(f as u64, 64)` — so `5.5` became `5`, `4.4` became `4`,
//! and `1.0 / 4.4` degraded to integer `1 / 4 = 0`. Real *signal* operands
//! were fine (they load as real Values and the VM does real arithmetic), so the
//! bug only bit expressions containing real *literals*. In a real PLL model
//! this drove clamp-mode `vcofbperiod = (1.0/4.4)*1000.0` to 0, and the
//! `always #(plloutperiod/2.0)` clock became a #0 spinner (zero-delay livelock).
//!
//! Fix: lower a real literal via `Value::from_f64`, preserving the IEEE-754
//! bits and `is_real` so the VM keeps it in the real domain. Procedural
//! (`initial`) evaluation was always correct — this only affected the compiled
//! comb/cont-assign path.
