//! LRM §16.5 — a CONCURRENT assertion's pass/fail action block must actually
//! run at a clock fire. Previously the action / `else` action were tallied but
//! never executed, so a failing `assert property (...) else $error(...)` was
//! silent — a verification hole. Now the `else` runs on a fail, the pass action
//! on a non-vacuous pass, a cover action on a match, and a VACUOUS pass runs
//! nothing. Cross-checked against iverilog and a commercial simulator.
