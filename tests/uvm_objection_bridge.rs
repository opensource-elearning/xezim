//! `wait` condition re-evaluation: the raise-then-drop synchronization idiom.
//!
//! IEEE 1800.1-2023 §10.4 `wait` suspends a process until its expression
//! becomes true, re-evaluating when any operand changes. A naive
//! implementation of "wait until all objections are dropped" as a bare
//! `wait(total == 0)` is wrong: at entry `total` is 0 (nothing has raised
//! yet), so the process returns immediately instead of waiting for a raise
//! followed by a drop. The correct idiom is the raise-then-drop pair:
//!
//! ```systemverilog
//! wait(total > 0);   // block until something is raised
//! wait(total == 0);  // then block until all are dropped
//! ```
//!
//! This is the plain-SV synchronization that an objection/phase waiter relies
//! on. Two facets are pinned here, both in pure SystemVerilog (no UVM
//! library, no special build mode):
//!
//!   1. The raise-then-drop idiom blocks until the drop (not released at t=0).
//!   2. The idiom works when the threshold/event is a VARIABLE (passed as a
//!      task argument), not only a literal condition.
